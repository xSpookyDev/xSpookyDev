ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @xSpookyDev

Iâ€™m from Chile. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡±

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about cloud computing, web development, and game development. My main focus areas include AWS, Go (Golang), Java, and Spring Boot for building robust backend systems. I also work with Three.js to create interactive 3D web experiences.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of cloud architecture and containerization with Kubernetes, enhancing my expertise in Go and Java for backend services, and exploring Spring Boot for microservices and enterprise-level applications. Additionally, Iâ€™m experimenting with Three.js to push the boundaries of web interactivity.

ðŸ’» I have experience creating websites and landing pages, developing engaging and functional web interfaces to meet various client needs.

ðŸŽ“ I am currently studying at Instituto Profesional San SebastiÃ¡n and will soon graduate from a Java Bootcamp, further solidifying my skills in backend development and Java programming.
