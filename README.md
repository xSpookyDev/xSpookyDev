👋 Hi, I’m @xSpookyDev

👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, web development, and game development. My main focus areas include AWS, Go (Golang), Java, and Spring Boot for building robust backend systems, as well as Three.js for creating interactive 3D experiences on the web.


🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud architecture and containerization with Kubernetes, deepening my expertise in Go and Java for backend services, and exploring Spring Boot for microservices and enterprise-level applications. I’m also experimenting with 
Three.js to push the boundaries of web interactivity.


💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve cloud migration, microservices architecture with Spring Boot and Go, or innovative web applications using Java or Three.js.
