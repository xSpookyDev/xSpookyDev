👋 Hi, I’m @xSpookyDev
👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, web development, and game development. My main focus areas include AWS, Go (Golang), and Three.js for building interactive 3D experiences on the web.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud architecture and containerization with Kubernetes, while also diving deeper into Go for backend services and exploring the possibilities of Three.js for creating immersive web applications.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve cloud migration, microservices with Go, or innovative web applications using Three.js.
